Populating the Maven Repository Manager

Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c provides a Maven Synchronization plug-in that simplifies the process of setting up repositories
and completely eliminates the need to know what patches are installed in a particular environment.
This plug-in enables you to populate a Maven repository from a given Oracle home.
After you patch your Oracle home, you should run this plug-in to ensure that your Maven repository matches Oracle home.
This ensures that your builds use correct versions of all artifacts in that particular environment.
The Oracle Maven Synchronization Plug-in is included in the Oracle WebLogic Server,


Installing Oracle Maven Synchronization Plug-In


The Maven Project Object Model (POM) file that describes the plug-in, which is located at:
ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.1.2/oracle-maven-sync.12.1.2.pom

The JAR file that contains the plug-in, which is located at:
ORACLE_HOME/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.1.2/oracle-maven-sync.12.1.2.jar

To install the plug-in into your local Maven repository, run the following command from the
ORACLE_COMMON/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.1.2 directory:

mvn install:install-file -DpomFile=oracle-maven-sync.12.1.2.pom -Dfile=oracle-maven-sync.12.1.2.jar


The simplest way deploy the plug-in into a shared internal repository, use the web user interface provided by your
Maven Repository Manager to upload the JAR file into the repository.

An alternative method is to use the deploy plug-in, which you can do by using a command like the following from the
ORACLE_COMMON/oracle_common/plugins/maven/com/oracle/maven/oracle-maven-sync/12.1.2 directory:
mvn deploy:deploy-file -DpomFile=oracle-maven-sync-12.1.2.pom -Dfile=oracle-maven-sync-12.1.2.jar
-Durl=http://servername/archiva/repositories/internal -DrepositoryId=internal
